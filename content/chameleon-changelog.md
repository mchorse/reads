## Version 1.1

This is a major internal rewrite whose purpose is to make Chameleon independent from GeckoLib. [GeckoLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) is still an awesome library that I would recommend anyone who is doing animated entities and blocks, however, it doesn't personally satisfy me anymore.

The motivation behind this update is to be able to fix bugs on my end, rather than on GeckoLib's end. 

**Compatible** with McLib `2.3.5`, Metamorph `1.2.7`. It doesn't mean that future versions of McLib or Metamorph would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Added support for Bedrock Smooth keyframes (`catmullrom`)
* Added new base code (written from scratch) that replaces GeckoLib's animation and model loading code
* Fixed the crash with missing faces in per-face UV mode
* Removed `geckolib` from dependencies

I tried to replace everything that GeckoLib was offering, however there are a couple of features that are missing: step interpolation, and support for overshoot/bounciness factor for back, elastic and bounce interpolations. Beside that, everything else should be the same.

## Version 1.0.3

This is a small patch has 2 features and bug fixes.

**Compatible** with McLib `2.3`, Metamorph `1.2.7` and GeckoLib `3.0.0`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph, Aperture and GeckoLib would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Added copy/paste context menu to Chameleon's pose editor
* Added support for folders (nested models) in Chameleon's models folder (suggested by The Minebox)
* Fixed Chameleon morphs disappearing when changing animations
* Fixed face alpha culling due to global OpenGL leaking (reported by Moris)

## Version 1.0.2

This is a small patch that is required for new versions of McLib.

**Compatible** with McLib `2.2`, Metamorph `1.2.5` and GeckoLib `3.0.0`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph, Aperture and GeckoLib would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Fixed configuration ID (due to mod ID change in previous patch) being broken
* Fixed multi-part not updating when closing morph editor with texture picker opened
* Fixed animations were not updating on present morphs (reported by Silverx)
* Fixed dedicated server crashing (reported by Nazzy)

## Version 1.0.1

**Compatible** with McLib `2.1.2`, Metamorph `1.2.4` and GeckoLib `3.0.0`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph, Aperture and GeckoLib would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Changed the mod ID from `chameleon` to `chameleon_morph`

**Compatible** with McLib `2.1.2`, Metamorph `1.2.4` and GeckoLib `3.0.0`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph, Aperture and GeckoLib would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.
