## Version 1.3.2

Quick feature patch update. Special thanks to Crazy for sponsoring this update! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Ž

**Compatible** with McLib `2.3.5` and Metamorph `1.2.9`. It doesn't mean that future versions of McLib, Blockbuster and Metamorph would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Added ability to add action variants. For example, you have an action called `idle`, if you add more animations in Blender starting with `idle:`, for example `idle:1` or `idle:one`, then they would be variants. You can add as many as you want as long as it in `action_name:variant` format (see full list [here](https://github.com/mchorse/chameleon/wiki/Animation-actions)). The order of action variants is starting with original action name, i.e. `idle`, and then sorted alphabetically by character/ASCII value.
