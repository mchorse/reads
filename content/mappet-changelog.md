## Version 0.1.5

This update is brought to you by TorayLife, with some neat QoL features, triggers and bug fixes!

**Compatible** with McLib **2.3.5**, Blockbuster **2.3** and Metamorph **1.2.9**. It doesn't mean that future versions of McLib, Blockbuster and Metamorph would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Added new triggers:
    * `Player: log out` trigger gets triggered with a subject player when player logs off the server
    * `Player: interact an item` trigger gets triggered when a player right clicks (interacts with) an item in the air
* Added scripting methods:
    * `IMappetUIBuilder.paused(boolean)` which allows to make UI pausable in singleplayer (by McHorse)
    * `IMappetStates.isNumber(String)` and `IMappetStates.isString(String)` allow to check whether given state is of number or string type
    * `IScriptItemStack.copy()` which allows to duplicate an item stack
* Added new string value comparison types: 
    * Exact match of given string (value == "...")
    * Contains somewhere in the value a string (value contains "...")
    * Regular expression match (value matches /.../)
* Added comment node to dialogues, which passes execution to its connected child nodes, but the main feature is to label or comment sections of the dialogue
* Added a feature for emitter block to check against players within the radius (rather than globally) when `radius > 0`
* Fixed `Entity: hurt` trigger getting triggered only when a player hurts an entity (and not when other entities hurt each other)
* Fixed server states editor switching back to `~` upon return back to panel instead of refreshing currently selected states (by McHorse)
